Although more troublesome to receive than a student visa, after you do not need to worry about proving school. Also hopefully you can extend it for one more year without much pain.


Apply as soon as possible, and for sure before your touristic visa will expire. As they may ask you for more documents, which can be obtained only from your country of origin, this process may take some time. Once you are in this process, you can stay in Brasil legally, even if tourist visa will expire. \
